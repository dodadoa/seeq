# `anu`

backend-agnostic step-sequencer/live-coding envoronment that harnesses the power of matching patterns ("RegEx") to create triggers. as the name suggests "anu" (or "อนุ"), which in Thai grammar denotes a prefix meaning "small", "sub" or "minor". it can be compatible with any others software/hardware that support [ OSC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) or [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) protocol (more to be implemented).
 
unlike others conventional tools or step-sequencers, "anu" explore a new musical expressions and territories, while still balancing deterministic and stochastic processes (previously developed under the name "seeq").
